.SH DESCRIPTION
This linker understands only the object files produced by the as86 assembler,
it can link them into either an impure or a separate I&D executable.

The linking defaults are everything off or none except for
.B -0
and the output file is
.BR a.out .
There is
.I not
a standard library location defined in the linker.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -0
produce header with 16-bit magic
.\"and use library subdir i86 for -lx
.TP
.B -3
produce header with 32-bit magic
.\"and use library subdir i386 for -lx
.TP
.B -d
delete the header from the output file, used for MSDOS COM files. As a side
effect this also includes -s as there's nowhere to put a symbol table.
.TP
.B -Cx
add file libdir-from-search/crtx.o to list of files linked
.TP
.B -D
data base address follows (in format suitable for strtoul)
.TP
.B -H
the top of heap (initial stack) address (in format suitable for strtoul)
.TP
.B -Lx
add dir name x to the head of the list of library dirs searched
.TP
.B -M
print symbols linked on stdout
.TP
.B -N
Create a native Linux OMAGIC output file. If the contents are i386 code the
binary can be either linked by GCC or executed by linux.
.TP
.B -Ox
add library libdir-from-search/x to list of files linked
.TP
.B -T
text base address follows (in format suitable for strtoul)
.TP
.B -i
separate I&D output
.TP
.B -lx
add library libdir-from-search/libx.a to list of files linked
.TP
.B -m
print modules linked on stdout
.TP
.B -o
output file name follows
.TP
.B -s
strip symbols
.TP
.B -r
Generate a relocatable object from one source object, if the linker is
given the -N option also the output format will be the hosts native format
if possible.
.TP
.B -t
trace modules being looked at on stdout
.TP
.B -z
produce "unmapped zero page" executables
.P
All the options not taking an argument may be turned off by following the
option letter by a '-', as for cc1.
.SH HISTORY

The 6809 version does not support -i.

The previous versions of the linker could produce an 8086 executable with
segments of a size >64k, now only i386 executables may have segments
this large.

.SH BUGS
The linker cannot deal with reverse seeks caused by
.B org
instructions in the object file. Unlike previous versions the current one
traps the error rather than trying to fill up the hard disk.

The linker produces a broken a.out object file if given one input and the
.B -r
option this is so it is compatible with pre-dev86 versions.
