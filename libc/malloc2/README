This is just the malloc for libc.  It is untested; it won't even compile
right now.  In particular, __malloc_init needs some bug fixing!

Apparently, there is another malloc that Robert Debath wrote which probably
works by now.  However, I honestly think that my malloc may be just as
good when it's finished.

In about six months, you'll probably see something like this:


Linux/less-than-32-bit installation program
Do you want
	1.  Chad Page's kernel
	2.  Alan Cox's kernel
Enter your chioce --> 2
Do you want
	1.  Robert Debath's malloc
	2.  Joel Weber's malloc
[more choices for compilers, filetools, etc]
